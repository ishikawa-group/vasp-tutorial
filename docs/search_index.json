tutorial\nIntroduction\n\nThis repository is for those who want to learn the DFT (density functional theory) calculations using VASP.\nVASP stands for Vienna ab initio simulation package, and it is the software package to do the DFT calculation with plane-wave basis set.\nThe webpage: https://ishikawa-group.github.io/vasp_tutorial/\n\nContents\n\nLinux (jumps to a file in other repository)\nEnergy calculation of molecule\nEnergy calculation of bulk and surface\nGeometry optimization\nAdsorption\nMolecular dynamics\nAtomic vacancy\nDensity of state\n\nOther topics\n\nFollowings should be seen if necessary:\n\ntsubame.md (jumps to a file in other repository)\ncompile.md (Japanese only)\n\n\nThe test directory contains input files for a simple VASP calculaiton. You can use it to check your VASP compiation is correctly done or not.\nThese examples are selected from VASP wiki.\n\nCO molecule geometry optimization: https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/CO\n\n\n\n"},"markdown/english/energy_molecule.html":{"url":"markdown/english/energy_molecule.html","title":"Energy calculation of molecules","keywords":"","body":"Energy calculation (molecule)\n\nIn this section, we will see how to calculate the energy of molecules. Let's take a carbon monooxide (CO) molecule as an example.\nThe energy here means the total energy, which is the sum of the electronic energy and the nuclear repulsion energy. The total energy is the energy expectation value of Schroedinger equation (under the Born-Oppenheimer approximation).\nIn VASP, you always need INCAR, POSCAR, KPOINTS, and POTCAR files.\nThese files should be stored in the same directory, and one directry corresponds to one VASP calculation. The VASP command should be executed in that directory.\nThe example here is taken from the VaspWiki: https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/CO\n\nINCAR\n\nThis file specifies the computational condition in VASP. In this file, you need to specify tag-variable pairs.\nVariable might be integer, float, logical (.TRUE. or .FALSE.), and string.\nThe minimal INCAR file is something like below. The details will be explained later or see VaspWiki website.\n\nSYSTEM = CO molecule in a box\nISMEAR =  0\nNSW    =  0\nIBRION = -1\n\nThe keywords above is just simple examples of the INCAR tags. These mean\nSYSTEM: A free keyword to identify the calculation.\nISMEAR: This tag sets a smearing method for the electron occupation near the Fermi level.\nNSW: This tag controls the number of ionic steps i.e. geometry optimization steps.\nIBRION: Controls the motion of ions. IBRION = -1 means energy calculation at given geometry.\n\n\nDetails of other INCAR tags are explained in incar.md.\n\nPOSCAR\n\nThis file gives the element species and positions of atoms.\nPOSCAR consists of three parts:\nThe top part gives the size of the unit cell.\nThe middle part gives the number of each elements.\nThe last part gives x-, y-, and z-coordinates of atoms.\n\n\n\nCO molecule in a box\n1.0\n8.0 0.0 0.0\n0.0 8.0 0.0\n0.0 0.0 8.0\nC O\n1 1\nCartesian\n0.0 0.0 0.0\n0.0 0.0 1.1\n\nEach lines have following meanings:\nCO molecule in a box: Title\n1.0          : universal scaling parameters\n8.0 0.0 0.0  : lattice vector  a(1)\n0.0 8.0 0.0  : lattice vector  a(2)\n0.0 0.0 8.0  : lattice vector  a(3)\nC O          : elements (this line can be omitted)\n1 1          : number of atoms for each species\nCartesian    : positions in cartesian coordinates\n0.0 0.0 0.0  : first atom x, y, z (in Angstrom)\n0.0 0.0 1.1  : second atom x, y, z (in Angstrom)\n\n\nNote that the first line of xyz-coordinate part has two lines. The first line corresponds to the carbon atom, and the second does the oxygen atom. So the xyz-coordinate part uses the information of the middle part (element number specification).\nFor example, to calculate CO2 molecule\n\n...\nC O\n1 2\ncart\n0.0 0.0 1.1   ! carbon\n0.0 0.0 0.0   ! oxygen\n0.0 0.0 2.2   ! oxygen\nKPOINTS\n\nThis file specifies the number of k-points, used for the reciprocal lattice integration.\nThe details of the k-points will be given elsewhere.\nFor the isolated atom/molecule calculation, you should use the following KPOINTS file corresponding to the Gamma-point calculation.\n\nGamma-point only\n0\nMonkhorst Pack\n1 1 1\n0 0 0\nPOTCAR\n\nThis file has the information of pseudo-potentials of each element.\nPseudo-potential information of all elements in POSCAR should be stored one POTCAR file.\nIn VASP, mehtod called the projector augumented-wave (PAW) is used.\nPOTCAR file can be generated by the Linux command:\ncat {POTCAR_directory}/C/POTCAR > POTCAR\ncat {POTCAR_directory}/O/POTCAR >> POTCAR\n\n\nNote that cat text_file > new_file copies the text file to a new file, and cat text_file >> new_file appends to new_file.\n{POTCAR_directory} depends on the installation setting. If you don't know the directry, ask your superviser.\nUsually, a directory like potpaw... is what you want.\n\nExecuting VASP\n\nWhen all the files i.e. INCAR, POSCAR, KPOINTS, and POTCAR are made, you can execute the vasp in the directory.\nNote: the following command is if you have VASP in your computer. If you are using supercomputers, use different command (see the following section).\nvasp_std >& {output_filename}\n\n\nTo execute above, vasp_std should be included in the directories in your PATH.\n\nHow to execute job in supercomputers\n\nNow we will asssume using TSUBAME.\nThe supercomputer usually uses the job queueing system, to take control of the calculations of many users. The queing system assigns the jobs to vacant nodes (computers).\nYou need to submit the job in a login node, the computer you first login to use the TSUBAME. The computation is done in other nodes, and you do not need to login these computational nodes.\nYou need to write the command in the job script file (with .sh or .csh filetype). The computational node executes the command written in that file.\n\nWriting job script\n\nWe use the library called the message passing interface (MPI) to do the parallel calculation (using single or multiple computational nodes)\nThe script example is written here:\nhttps://helpdesk.t3.gsic.titech.ac.jp/manuals/handbook.ja/jobs/\n\n\nHere we modify the example script with MPI and intel-mpi. The file is named as run.sh (see somewhere).\n\nSubmitting a job\n\nqsub: qsub -g [TSUBAME_group] run.sh\nTSUBAME_group: Name of your TSUBAME group. If you don't specify this, the job becomes trial mode (limited execution time).\n\n\nIf your input files are correctly made, the output files (e.g. OUTCAR) will be generated in the directory.\n\nJob controls\nChecking the job status\n\nqstat command gives the job status: qstat [option]\n\nStopping or deleting the job\n\nqdel: qdel JOB_ID\n\nAnalyzing output files\n\nOSZICAR: This file contains a summary of the iteration loop.\nOUTCAR: This file writes down everything about the run.\nThe most important output is the total energy of this system.\nThis is found in line energy without entropy = -13.82671748  energy(sigma->0) = -13.82671748 in OUTCAR.\nThe exact values may change depending on the environment.\nAmong these values, use the latter one (i.e. energy(sigma->0)). The energy is defined in eV (electron volt) unit.\n\n\n\nVisualization\nVESTA\n\nFor visualization, you can use VESTA for free: https://jp-minerals.org/vesta/jp/\nAfter installing VESTA, you can see the structure of POSCAR by \"Open\" -> \"POSCAR\".\nIt is useful to set alias to ~/.bashrc file (in mac)\nalias vesta=/Applications/VESTA.app/Contents/MacOS/VESTA\n\nthen you can use vesta POSCAR.\n\n\nASE\n\nWhen using ASE, you can see the POSCAR file with: ase gui POSCAR.\n\nOvito\n\nOvito visualization software is sometimes useful because it has many functionalities (that VESTA doen't have): https://www.ovito.org/\n\nExercise\n\nFor CO molecule, change the position of the second atom (O atom, 0.0 0.0 1.1 in the above example) to 0.9, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.3 and see the change in the energy.

Thus we can consider the stable molecules or bulk (observed experimentally) have the optimized structures.\nThe optimized geometry thus can be compared with exprimental molecular or solid strucutures, which is identified by the X-ray or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods.\n\nOptimization of bulk\nPOSCAR\n\nPOSCAR is the same with the energy calculation.\nLet's take the Pt example (file).Pt \n1.0000000\n   3.9231600    0.0000000    0.0000000\n   0.0000000    3.9231600    0.0000000\n   0.0000000    0.0000000    3.9231600\nPt \n 4\nCartesian\n0.0000000  0.0000000  0.0000000\n1.9615800  1.9615800  0.0000000\n0.0000000  1.9615800  1.9615800\n1.9615800  0.0000000  1.9615800\n\n\nINCAR\n\nThe INCAR file for the geometry optimization is as follows.SYSTEM = Pt bulk\nISMEAR =  1\nNSW    = 10\nIBRION =  2\n\nIBRION = 1 or 2 specifies to do geometry optimization.

This is what the geometry optimizaitons are doing: the atoms are relaxed, in order to lower the energy.\nAlso check the energy in OUTCAR (the latter value of the following line):\nenergy without entropy = -1070.27460902  energy(sigma->0) = -1070.45373832\ngrep is useful for this purpose: grep \"energy  without entropy\" OUTCAR\n\n\nYou can see the energy is (mostly) decreasing.

This is reasonable, because, in reallity, only surface atoms moves significantly and lower part have similar structure with bulk material.\nTo do such calculation, we fix the lower part of the surface model and only relax the upper layers.

Possible variables are\n\nNNN: number of particles (atoms, molecules)\nVVV: volume of the simulation cell\nTTT: temperature\nPPP: pressure\nHHH: enthalpy\n\n\nThe conserved variables are the variables kept constant during the MD simulation.\n\nUsually, three variables are chosen for the MD calculation, and the MD simulation is labeled by these conserved variables.\nFour types of ensembles are possible in VASP: NVE, NVT, NpT, and NpH. Among them, formar two ensembles are widely used, and also called microcanonical ensemble and canonical ensemble, respectively.\nNVT simulation is more usual so we will cover it here. Keeping NNN means we have no generation or elimination of the atoms or electsons (as usual simulations does). Keeping VVV means cell size is fixed during the simulation. So additional factor is the temperature of the system.\nTo control the temperature, we use thermostat. This is the heat bath connected to the system, and it supplies or extract the temperature to adjust the system's temperature to the target temperature value.\nFor NVTNVTNVT simulation, we have two options in VASP.\nBerendsen thermostat\nAndersen thermostat\nNose-Hoover thermostat\nLangevion thermostat\nMultiple Andersen thermostat\n\n\nAmong them, Berendesen and Nose-Hoover is popular so we will cover them here. How to set these thermostats with INCAR will be introduced later.\nUsually Berendsen thermostat is easier to use but Nose-Hoover is better from theoretical viewpoint. So we learn to use the Berendsen thermostat in this page.\nThe full details of the MD calculation in VASP is shown in https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/Molecular_dynamics_calculations\n\nINCAR setting\n\nThe MD-specific keywords are as follows:\nCommon to all MD calculation\nSet IBRION to 0.\nNSW: The number of steps (same with geometry optimization).\nPOTIM: In MD calculation, this means the timestep in femtosecond (fs, 10−1510^{-15}10−15 s). Usually, 0.5-2.0 should be used.\n\n\nCommon to all NVT MD calculation\nTEBEG: Target temperature (in Kelvin) at the beggining of the MD.\nTEEND: Target temperature at the end of the MD. If this value is different from TEBEG, gradual increase/decrease of temperature during MD is taken.\n\n\nWhen using Berendsen thermostat\nSet SMASS to -1.\nNBLOCK: Frequency of the velocity scaling. Setting this value to, for example 10, means temperature is scaled every 10 steps.\n\n\nWhen using Nose-Hoover thermostat\n\nSet SMASS to some positive value (0.5~2.0 is standard).\nMDALGO = 2.\n\n\nSo the INCAR part for the Berendsen NVT MD becomes like\n\n\nIBRION =  0\nPOTIM  =  1.0\nSMASS  = -1\nNSW    =  100\nNBLOCK =  10\nTEBEG  =  300\nTEEND  =  300\n\nIn Nose-Hoover, temperature fluctuates around the target value. Adjusting the SMASS value may resolve this to some extent.\nSMASS in Nose-Hoover controls the frequency of the coupling to the heat bath, so it is a parameter we need to fix. Usually, larger SMASS leads slow increase/decrease of temperature.\n\nPOSCAR\n\nAny POSCAR file is fine. A file with 32 water molecules are prepared; see POSCAR_MD.\nCopy it to POSCAR and do the calculation.\n\nKPOINTS\n\nNothing special with the KPOINTS file. For above water case, 1x1x1 k-point is fine.\n\nPOTCAR\n\nPrepare as usual.\n\nOUTPUT\n\nIn standard output (.out) or OSZICAR, the simulation temperature is written (T=300). See how these temperatures are changing.\nThe trajectory can be seen in vasprun.xml or OUTCAR file. vasurun.xml is lighter in size so analyze it by ase gui vasprun.xml (after getting .xml file to your local PC).\n\nExersice\n\nPerform the MD calculation above.\n\n"},"markdown/english/dos.html":{"url":"markdown/english/dos.html","title":"Density of state","keywords":"","body":"Density of state (DOS)\nIntroduction\n\nDensity of States (DOS) represents the number of available electronic states at some energy.\nIt is a fundamental concept in solid-state physics and materials science, providing crucial information about the electronic structure and properties of materials.\n\nPhysical meaning of DOS\nFundamental concept\n\nDOS represents the number of states available for electron occupation at energy EEE.\nHigher DOS indicates more states available for electron occupation, which is often useful for electronic conduction, making/breaking chemical bonds, magnetization etc.\nThe energy region with (1) non-zero DOS, (2) below the Fermi energy is called the valence band, and the region with (1) non-zero DOS, (2) above the Fermi energy is called the conduction band.

Here, we will focus on the oxygen vacancy of transition metal oxides, as this is widely studied case.\n\nIntroduction\n\nOxygen vacancies are point defects that occur when oxygen atoms are missing from their regular lattice positions in transition metal oxide.\nThese defects play a crucial role in determining the physical, chemical, and electronic properties of materials.\n\nTheoretical background\nVacancy formation energy\n\nThe formation energy of an oxygen vacancy is a key parameter that quantifies the energy required to create a vacancy. It is calculated as:\nEvac=Edefect−Epristine+nO⋅μO\nE_{\\rm vac} = E_{\\rm defect} - E_{\\rm pristine} + n_O\\cdot\\mu_O\nEvac​=Edefect​−Epristine​+nO​⋅μO​\nwhere:\nEdefectE_{\\rm defect}Edefect​: Total energy of the system with the oxygen vacancy\nEpristineE_{\\rm pristine}Epristine​: Total energy of the prinstine (i.e., without defect) system\nnOn_OnO​: Number of oxygen atoms removed (typically 1)\nμO\\mu_OμO​: Chemical potential of oxygen\n\n\nAccording to this definition, a small EvacE_{\\rm vac}Evac​ value means oxygen vacancy can be formed easily.\nThe chemical potential of oxygen (μO\\mu_OμO​) depends on temperature and partical pressure of O2O_2O2​ gas.

Structural analysis\n\nAnalyze the structural relaxation around the vacancy:\nMeasure the displacement of atoms neighboring the vacancy\nIdentify any symmetry breaking or structural distortions\n\nPractical considerations\nHybrid functionals\n\nFor more accurate electronic structure and formation energies, hybrid functionals (e.g., HSE06) can be used:LHFCALC = .TRUE.\nHFSCREEN = 0.2\nAEXX = 0.25\n\nUsing standard GGA functionals (such as PBE) is known to lead delocalized charge density. In reality, the charge density of oxygen vacancy material should localzed to the vacancy position. The hybrid functionals (or DFT + U method) is known to fix this problem.\nNote that hybrid functional calculations are computationally more demanding.\n\nTypical oxygen vacancy formation energies\n\nHere are some examples of oxygen vacancy formation energies (EvacE_{vac}Evac​) in typical metal oxides calculated using DFT:\nYou can see the oxygen vacancy formation energy depends on the material, and also on the calculation method.\n\n\n\n\nMaterial\nE_vac (eV)\nMethod\nReference\n\n\n\n\nTiOX2\\ce{TiO2}TiOX2​ (rutile, (110) surface)\n2.16\nPBE\n[1]\n\n\nTiOX2\\ce{TiO2}TiOX2​ (rutile, (110) surface)\n3.66\nPBE + U\n[1]\n\n\nCeOX2\\ce{CeO2}CeOX2​ ((111) surface)\n2.60\nPW91 + U\n[2,3]\n\n\nSrTiOX3\\ce{SrTiO3}SrTiOX3​\n6.0\nHSE06\n[4]\n\n\nLaAlOX3\\ce{LaAlO3}LaAlOX3​\n8.3\nHSE06\n[4]\n\n\n\n\nMorgan, B.
